# Club Information Management Portal (Frontend Only)
This is a **frontend UI design** for an admin portal built as part of the CodeChef recruitment challenge. The interface is intended to help Student Welfare Committee members manage clubs at VIT.

This project is focused purely on the **visual layout (HTML & CSS)**. No backend functionality or interactivity has been implemented.

## Features (UI Only)
- Top header with logo and title
- Sidebar navigation menu
- Club list with styled cards
- Responsive layout using basic HTML and CSS

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS (no frameworks)
- Designed for visual presentation only (no JS or backend)

## Purpose
This project was built to showcase my understanding of web structure, layout, and styling using raw HTML and CSS. It represents what the club management portal **could look like**, not a functional application.
